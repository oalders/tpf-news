# Want to Sponsor The Perl Conference?
A donation to The Perl Foundation not only contributes to the Perl Conference in Salt Lake City, but also aids our other outreach programs. Perl Foundation Sponsors will get recognition for supporting The Perl Conference as well as our regional Perl Workshops, our Outreach Program for Women, beginner training initiatives, and our grants programs for an entire year. Donating directly to The Perl Foundation is the way to get the most value for your sponsorship money.

For more information about donating to The Perl Foundation check out our prospectus: [http://donate.perlfoundation.org/prospectus.html](http://donate.perlfoundation.org/prospectus.html). 

Sponsors can also donate directly to The Perl Conference. Often the organizers are able to link a sponsor directly to an event at the conference ( wifi, coffee break, etc )  where the cost of the event is in line with the donation amount. Email [treasurer@perlfoundation.org](mailto:treasurer@perlfoundation.org) for more information or to donate directly to this year’s event.

Sponsors of $500 or more will be provided a table at our sponsor expo and job fair.
