# Give a Lightning Talk
Lightning Talks are short, 5 minute, talks that may be serious, funny, or both. They may be given by experienced speakers already giving full length talks or by first time speakers just starting out (this is a great way to get started if you have something to say). Adding the virtual component to lightning talks should add for some extra fun! If you are a first time speaker you will win a tie with an experienced speaker when the schedule is made, if it comes to it. Today’s first time speaker could be tomorrow’s keynote speaker!
