# About the Conference in the Cloud
The 2020 Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud will be on June 24-26. If you see #TPRCiC around on social media, that’s our tag for the conference.

At the Conference in the Cloud there will be Perl, Raku, and other related technology topics, just like you’ve seen at our in-person conferences. The Conference in the Cloud is organized and run by volunteers just like The Perl and Raku Conference. Presentations are also given by volunteers. The presentations at the conference will be submitted during our Call For Presentations (CFP) and selected by organizers who volunteer to be on our talks-committee. We will have 2 or more tracks at this event with presentations (20-50 minutes long) on a variety of technical topics throughout each day.

# Registration Cost
By paying a $10 fee attendees can interact live with speakers and other attendees (during BOFs, panels, and Q&A). The $10.00 fee is inclusive of the entire event. This fee helps secure a safe event, and covers the minor costs of hosting it.

# Conference Time
In order to accommodate the most time zones possible, we have decided to go with 11AM to 6PM EDT or 15:00 to 22:00 UTC. You can use this [world clock meeting planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?month=6&day=24&year=2020&p1=224&p2=179&p3=16&p4=240&p5=248&iv=0) to visualize what this looks like for your time zone.

# Hosting Platform
The Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud (TPRCiC) is going to be an online, interactive event hosted on the Zoom platform. The broadcast will be recorded and streamed simultaneously to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/yapcna). 

The conference organizers had a few goals in mind when selecting an online platform to host the Conference in the Cloud. The selected platform needed to have easy-to-use tools for administrators, as well as participants of all technical levels. It needed to offer operating support not only for macOS and Windows, but also for Linux operating systems. Given the planning time constraints and nature of the conference, organizers decided a ready out of the box solution is the best choice.

It is known that there are security and privacy concerns with the Zoom platform. TPRCiC organizers are going to do their best to set the platform up as safely as possible, while Zoom continues to improve the security of their platform. TPRCiC will be configured so that only the presenter has ability to talk and present. All others will be muted and will need to request access to speak (to ask a question or make a comment) or share video.


Access to the interactive conference on Zoom will only be granted to people who register in advance, agree to the Code of Conduct, and pay a $10 registration fee for the whole conference. Presentations will be streamed live to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/yapcna) so those who can’t pay the fee or won’t use Zoom, can still access most conference content. [BOFs](ht
