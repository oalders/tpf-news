<h2 dir="ltr">Volunteers needed</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The Perl Conference is 100% volunteer powered! We need your help! If youâ€™re able to donate even a few hours, it goes a long way to helping TPC run smoothly.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many volunteer needs can be fulfilled while still enjoying the fantastic sessions we have scheduled this year. Additionally, volunteers who provide at least 2 hours of help in a single day are eligible to take advantage of the free catered lunch for conference staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in helping during the event please fill out the volunteer application form, <a href="http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer">http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer</a>. If you sign up to donate at least 16 hours of your time between June 17th and June 22nd, youâ€™ll receive a free pass to the the main conference Jun 18 - Jun 20.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Lightning Talks</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A lightning talk is a quick 5 minute (or less) presentation. The topic may be serious, funny, or both. There will be space for 10 lightning talk presentations each on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lightning-talk-givers can be first time speakers or experienced presenters, and everyone in between! Itâ€™s open to anyone, but to secure your 5 minutes in the spotlight you should sign-up early. <a href="http://bit.ly/TPCLightningTalks">http://bit.ly/TPCLightningTalks</a></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Tickets and Lodging - extra rooms</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The organizers of the conference reserved some of the external motel style rooms and there are a few units that havenâ€™t been allocated yet.

They will be transferred on a first come, first serve basis. Send requests to <a href="mailto:admin@perlconference.us">admin@perlconference.us</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Itâ€™s not too late to purchase your ticket to attend TPC! With all kinds of topics and useful sessions, even at the late registration price itâ€™s a great value.
