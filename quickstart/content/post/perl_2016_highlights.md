The Perl Foundation is excited to have a booth at [OSCON](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx) again this year. As part of our booth information and outreach we've put together a summary of some of the activities in the Perl world from 2016.

## Perl 5

The Perl 5 teams continued the steady release of new versions of Perl 5 with the release of 5.24 in 2016. This release included enhancements to regular expressions, Unicode 8.0 support, and security updates. A full list of changes for all perl versions is available in the [perl history part of the perl documentation](http://perldoc.perl.org/index-history.html).

Looking forward, the upcoming 5.26 release includes numerous speed improvements (including speedier subroutine signatures), Unicode 9.0 support, indented here-documents, and many bug fixes.

The following events supported continued development on the Perl 5 ecosystem:

* [Perl QA Hackathon](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/05/the-qa-hackathon-2016-was-a-great-success.html)
* [Perl 5 Core Hackathon](http://blogs.perl.org/users/sawyer_x/2017/02/perl-5-core-hackathon-p5hack-report.html)

## Perl 6

In 2016 the emphasis in Perl 6 development has been on stability and performance enhancements. An example of this is a 2.5x speed improvement for a common task such as reading a CSV file with the pure Perl 6 version of Text::CSV. Also, memory usage has dropped significantly in 2016, making it easier to run Perl 6 on smaller devices. Using Perl 5 modules (e.g. from CPAN) using Inline::Perl5 has also become 2x as fast. Check out [Perl 6 Weekly](https://p6weekly.wordpress.com) if you want to keep up-to-date on Perl 6 development.

In addition to Perl 6 development, brian d foy held a [successful Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1422827986/learning-perl-6) to fund writing “Learning Perl 6” in the same tradition as O’Reilly’s successful [“Learning Perl”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920018452.do).

## Over $1 Million in Grants Awarded

## MetaCPAN

MetaCPAN is a search engine for CPAN, the Perl module hosting system (http://metacpan.org). It has brought a huge amount of new metadata to perl modules since its launch in 2015. This year, the team completed a project to update nearly all of the components of the site and version the API. Details of the project are available in [blog posts from the team](http://blogs.perl.org/users/leo_lapworth/2016/11/metahack---metacpan-upgrade.html).

CPAN itself continues to be a reliable resource for providing access to over
