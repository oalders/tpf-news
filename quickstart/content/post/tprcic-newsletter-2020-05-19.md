# Check out the schedule
We’ve got a lot of great talks lined up! The schedule is available on our [website](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/schedule/). 
 
# Give a Lightning Talk
Lightning Talks are short, 5 minute, talks that may be serious, funny, or both. They may be given by experienced speakers already giving full length talks or by first time speakers just starting out (this is a great way to get started if you have something to say). Adding the virtual component to lightning talks should add for some extra fun! If you are a first time speaker you will win a tie with an experienced speaker when the schedule is made, if it comes to it. Today’s first time speaker could be tomorrow’s keynote speaker! [Sign up here](https://forms.gle/bNHanketR4MjhhXh8).
 
# Volunteers Needed
The Conference in the Cloud needs some volunteers! Email [admin@perlconference.us](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/contact/) to volunteer. Right now we need volunteers to help moderate rooms and coordinate day-of things:
* Room moderators - Monitor the chat and help coordinate audience participation during a virtual presentation.
* Room Hosts - Help coordinate speakers and manage the live stream to YouTube
 
# Host a Birds of a Feather (BoF)
Do you have a topic you'd like to host for a virtual Birds of Feather (BoF) meeting? We'd love to help! Virtual meeting space will be reserved for BoFs on a first come, first served basis. To get started reserving space, email an organizer at [admin@perlconference.us](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/contact/) with your BoF topic and requirements no later than June 1. 

 
#Master class - Introduction to Go 
Do you want to learn Go? Instructor Dave Rolsky will cover syntax, the type system, OO, packages and more in this virtual "Introduction to Go" master class. It's on Saturday, June 27 for just $50 (all proceeds from this class go to The Perl Foundation). Get more details about the “Introduction to Go” master class on our [schedule](https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud/schedule/).
# Order your conference shirt
We designed a logo and we’re sharing it with the community! Order a shirt or other cloud conference items at [CafePress](https://www.cafepress.com/perlandrokuconference). We aren’t making any money (neither is TPF) on these products but we have designed a logo if you’d like to buy a momento!
# About the Conference in the Cloud
The 2020 Perl and Raku Conference in the Cloud will be on June 24-26. If you see #TPRCiC around on social media, that’s our tag for the conference.
 
At the Conference in the Cloud there will be Perl, Raku, and other related technology topics, just like you’ve seen at our in-person conferences. The Conference in the Cloud is organized and run by volunteers just like The Perl and Raku Conference. Presentations are also given by volunteers. The presentations at the conference were submitted during our Call For Presentations (CFP) and selected by organizers who volunteered to be on our talks-committee. We will have 2 or more tracks at this event with presentations (20-50 minutes long) on a variety of technical topics throughout each day.
 
## Registration Cost
By paying a $10 fee attendees can interact live with speakers and other attendees (during BOFs, panels
