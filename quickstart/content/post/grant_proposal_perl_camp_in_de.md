## Synopsis

Perl Camp in Democratic Republic of Congo

20-21 December 2017


## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

We aim to organize a first nationwide Perl Camp in democratic republic of congo. During 2 days in Kinshasa, the capital city of the democratic republic of Congo, students, IT managers and developers will come together to learn, share ideas, discuss issues related to Perl finally to build their capacity in Perl and to cultivate  an active Perl developer community in democratic republic of Congo.

The first Perl Camp in the democratic republic of Congo will consist in a series of activities including (courses on Perl programming, debates and discussions, hackhaton, and leadership programs, etc) to allow participants to develop their skills and knowledge on Perl and leadership programme to enable participants to be able to lead a Perl community in their specific regions. Indeed, at the moment there is not an active Perl community in democratic republic and only few than 10 people know about Perl  in the country and use  Perl when it comes to choose the programming language, while  Perl has several and great advantages.

We plan through the first Perl Camp in democratic republic of Congo to bring around 150 participants coming from across the country to build their capacity on Perl and to create an active Perl community in the democratic republic of Congo.
