<h2>About #TPCiH</h2>
In 2020 we’ll be in Houston, Texas. The Perl Conference in Houston will use hashtag #TPCiH, which follows with previous years taking the first letter of the name (Pittsburgh: #TPCiP) or letters for cities with more than one word in their names (Salt Lake City: #TPCiSLC). So if you see #TPCiH around on social media, that’s our tag for The Perl Conference in Houston.

At The Perl Conference in Houston you can expect to see a lot of presentations on Perl and supporting languages. Core presentation topics in the past have included Perl 5 and Perl 6 (now Raku) and organizers are hopeful to continue with a core of Perl 5 and Raku moving forward. It’s worth noting that this event is run by volunteers and talks are also given by volunteers. The presentations at the conference will be submitted during our Call For Presentations (CFP) and selected by organizers who volunteer to be on our talks-committee. Generally, there are sets of 3 to 4 simultaneous presentations (20-50 minutes long) on a variety of topics throughout each main event day. Surrounding the main conference days, master-class tutorial sessions (half day and full day format) are offered for an additional fee.

Venue selection and finalization is in the works and all the specifics will be published as soon as possible for The Perl Conference in Houston! Note, the proposed event schedule differs from some of the past events. In 2020 organizers are trying a new format: Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for the main event days, and master-class tutorial sessions surrounding it on Tuesday and Saturday.

<h2>Be part of it all - Organizer spots open!</h2>
Planning for The Perl Conference in Houston is underway and we need a few more hands! It’s not too late to join us in planning this event! Openings are web design/content editor, speaking coordinator, outreach assistant, and more... Email admin@perlconference.us to volunteer. You can help frame the conference!

<h2>Call for Sponsors!</h2>
A donation to The Perl Foundation not only contributes to the Perl Conference in Houston, but also aids our other outreach programs. Perl Foundation Sponsors will get recognition for supporting The Perl Conference as well as our regional Perl Workshops, beginner training initiatives, and our grants programs for an entire year. Donating directly to The Perl Foundation is the way to get the most value for your sponsorship money.

Sponsors can also donate directly to The Perl Conference. Often the organizers are able to link a sponsor directly to an event at the conference ( wifi, coffee break, etc )  where the cost of the event is in line with the donation amount. Email treasurer@perlfoundation.org for more information or to donate directly to this year’s event.

Sponsors of $500 or more will be provided a table at our sponsor expo and job fair.

<h2>Which presentations are you hoping to see?</h2>
We’d love to hear your tech talk ideas for TPCiH! We’ve already received some interest in the following topics:

* Binding to a C library in Raku via nativecall
* Perl and Raku / Internet / History game show
* Security
* Fun side projects with Perl and Raku
* Integrating Perl and Raku with other tools

Maybe you have your own topic or see an idea here you want to present. It’s never too early to start planning a talk proposal so you’re ready to submit when the call for proposals is announced!
