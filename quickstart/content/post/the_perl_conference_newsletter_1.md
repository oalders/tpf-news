<h1 dir="ltr">BoF Event Space Still Available</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings have been a long-standing tradition at Perl Conferences where attendees â€˜flockâ€™ together to talk about a shared interest. This year organizers are giving you the opportunity to secure space early and get the word out about your BoF meeting.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">By registering a BoF early you can guarantee the most visibility through promotion. All BoF proposals must be approved by The Perl Conference Organizers. Registration does not guarantee room assignment. Rooms will be reserved for BoFs on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Get your BoF promoted and space reserved by requesting it here <a href="http://bit.ly/2GB1Fqy">http://bit.ly/2GB1Fqy</a>.</p>
