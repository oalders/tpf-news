The Perl Conference is a high-quality, inexpensive, technical Conference that celebrates the Perl programming language. The beauty of The Perl Conference is that it remains accessible to everyone regardless of experience, yet it is still valuable to the most skilled programmers. 

Each year the conference attracts hundreds of programmers from around the world, including luminaries such as Larry Wall, Ricardo Signes, and Damian Conway. We hope you will consider applying to present at this exciting event!

TPC 2018 in SLC will once again be held at the Little America Hotel from June 17-22.

We expect to have approximately one hundred (100) sessions across four (4) tracks with over four hundred (400) attendees. In addition, there will be professional tutorials and hackathons in the days prior to (June 17), and following (June 21-22), the main conference (June 18-20).

We are interested in hearing talks on a wide variety of subjects. This includes Perl 5, Perl 6, database integration, drones, puppies, and any other topics that may be of general interest to Perl programmers. Please review the talk schedules from previous years to help with additional ideas.

We will be accepting proposals for the following session types:


 - Short Talks (20 minutes)
 - Standard Talks (50 minutes)
 - Tutorial Session (80 or 110 minutes)
