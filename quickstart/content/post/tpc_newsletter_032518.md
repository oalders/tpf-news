<h1 dir="ltr"><span>Keynote Speaker: VM (Vicky) Brasseur</span></h1>
<p dir="ltr"><span>VM (aka Vicky) spent most of her 20 years in the tech industry leading software development departments and teams, and providing technical management and leadership consulting for small and medium businesses. Now she leverages nearly 30 years of free and open source software experience and a strong business background to advise companies about free/open source, technology, community, business, and the intersections between them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">She is the author of Forge Your Future with Open Source, the first book to detail how to contribute to free and open source software projects. Think of it as the missing manual of open source contributions and community participation. The book is published by The Pragmatic Programmers and is now available in an early release beta version. It's available at https://fossforge.com.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vicky is the proud winner of the Perl White Camel Award (2014) and the O’Reilly Open Source Award (2016). She's a moderator and author for opensource.com, a board member for the Open Source Initiative, and a frequent and popular speaker at free/open source conferences and events. She blogs about free/open source, business, and technical management at http://anonymoushash.vmbrasseur.com.</p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Register your Birds of a Feather (BoF) Event</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Birds of a Feather (BoF) gatherings have been a long-standing tradition at Perl Conferences. Attendees often ‘flock’ together to talk about a shared topic, that is sometimes inspired by a conversation that came up in the hallway or after a scheduled talk. BoFs are not limited to Perl specific topics though and sometimes attendees know ahead what BoF gathering they are hoping to find! This year organizers are giving you the opportunity to secure space and get the word out about your BoF meeting.</p>
<p>By registering a BoF early you can guarantee the most visibility through promotion. All BoF proposals must be approved by The Perl Conference Organizers. Registration does not guarantee room assignment. Rooms will be reserved for BoFs on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>Get your BoF promoted and space reserved by requesting it here <a href="http://bit.ly/2GB1Fqy">http://bit.ly/2GB1Fqy</a>.</p>
