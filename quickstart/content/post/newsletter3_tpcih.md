Whether this is your first time submitting a talk proposal or one of many you’ve proposed and presented, consider submitting your talk idea to TPCiH. Making a presentation at a national event is great for networking and experience! 

The presentations at the conference are selected by organizers who volunteer to be on our talks-committee. Generally, there are sets of 3 to 4 simultaneous presentations (20 or 50 minutes long, including Q&A) on a variety of technical topics throughout each main event day. 

Not sure you are up for giving a talk but have a topic you’d like to learn more about at our event? Tweet @PerlConferences using #TPCiH or email admin@perlconference.us.

Keep in mind, the event schedule differs from some of the past events. In 2020 organizers are trying a new format: Jun 24 (Wednesday), Jun 25 (Thursday), Jun 26 (Friday) for the presentation days. Master classes will be offered on Jun 23 (Tuesday) and Jun 27 (Saturday).
## Call for Teachers/Master-Class
We need to fill out our master-class/tutorial schedule for #TPCiH. We are especially interested in a “Learning Raku” course. All tutorial ideas will be considered. Please send your interest and expectations to admin@perlconference.us.

Keep in mind, the event schedule differs from some of the past events. Master-class tutorial sessions surrounding the main event and will be held on Jun 23 (Tuesday) and Jun 27 (Saturday).

Sponsor TPCiH
A donation to The Perl Foundation not only contributes to the Perl and Raku Conference in Houston, but also aids our other outreach programs. Perl Foundation Sponsors will get recognition for supporting The Perl and Raku Conference as well as our regional Perl Workshops, beginner training initiatives, and our grants programs for an entire year. Donating directly to The Perl Foundation is the way to get the most value for your sponsorship money.

Sponsors can also donate directly to The Perl and Raku Conference. Often the organizers are able to link a sponsor directly to an event at the conference ( wifi, coffee break, etc )  where the cost of the event is in line with the donation amount. Email treasurer@perlfoundation.org for more information
