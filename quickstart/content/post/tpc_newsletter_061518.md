<h2 dir="ltr"><span>Volunteers Needed</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The Perl Conference is 100% volunteer powered! We need your help during the main conference on June 18 - June 20! There's still room to volunteer for room moderator, camera operator, and runner positions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Volunteers who provide at least 2 hours of help in a single day are eligible to take advantage of the free catered lunch for conference staff. Anyone who gives 16 or more hours of time between June 17th and June 22nd gets a free pass to the main conference.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Fill out the application form to volunteer: </span><a href="http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer"> <span>http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Room Moderator</span><span>: This volunteer introduces each speaker prior to their talk. They work with the camera operator to ensure talks do not start until the videography team is ready to record. The room moderator also ensures that their room keeps to the schedule, cuing the speaker to end their talk as necessary. Room moderators also provide any special announcements between talks as instructed by the organizer staff.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Camera Operator</span><span>: </span><span>This volunteer uses the recording equipment setup in the conference room to start a recording at the beginning of a presentation and stop the recording at the end of the presentation. The camera operator may need to direct a runner and communicate with the videographer and assistant videographers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Runner</span><span>: This volunteer is available to help out as necessary with general duties. The runner may need to deliver something (an item or a message for example) to an organizer or fellow volunteer or help setup/breakdown a room.</span></p>
