<h1 dir="ltr">Conference Tickets and Lodging</h1>
<p dir="ltr">Did you know May 18th is the last day to register for the conference at the regular admission cost and the last day hotel rooms are guaranteed for TPC? After May 18th, event passes go up to $375. Save yourself over $100 and book today! Go ahead and reserve your hotel room now too, because the discounted $189/night rate ends May 18th as well. As of May 19th room rates increase to $199/night and there is no guarantee of availability.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">TPC recommends reserving suite-style rooms located inside the conference hotel, called â€œTowerâ€ rooms. These spacious rooms have amazing views overlooking Salt Lake City and are located inside the conference hotel. Let an agent know you are attending The Perl Conference when you book your lodging.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Note, self-parking is included for guests and attendees. Valet parking is available for $7 per day.</p>
<p></p>

<h1 dir="ltr">Volunteers needed</h1>
<p dir="ltr">The Perl Conference is 100% volunteer powered! We need your help! If youâ€™re able to donate even a few hours, it goes a long way to helping TPC run smoothly.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many volunteer needs can be fulfilled while still enjoying the fantastic sessions we have scheduled this year. Additionally, volunteers who provide at least 2 hours of help in a single day are eligible to take advantage of the free catered lunch for conference staff.</p>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">If you are interested in helping during the event please fill out the volunteer application form, <a href="http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer">http://bit.ly/tpcVolunteer</a>. If you sign up to donate at least 16 hours of your time between June 17th and June 22nd, youâ€™ll receive a free pass to the the main conference Jun 18 - Jun 20.</p>
