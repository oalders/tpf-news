In August of 2011 Gabor Szabo started an ambitious project intended to bring a snapshot of the Perl World to the wider community. That project was called "Perl Weekly":http://perlweekly.com/.

Gabor had seen an issue in the community, in order to follow the latest news, learn about the latest events or keep up-to-date with important elements of the community you were required to sift through a large number of blogs, news pages, Twitter feeds, Facebook updates, CPAN and MetaCPAN knowledge, hang out in irc channels and follow the 'right' people who seemed to release the information. This is quite a task and most people are too busy with their personal and professional lives and don't normally have feeds to this information. Gabor, of course, had as he has always been deeply involved in the Perl community.

After "viewing other newsletters":http://szabgab.com/curated-weekly-newsletters.html, most especially "Javascript Weekly":http://javascriptweekly.com/ which was a heavy influence on "Perl Weekly":http://perlweekly.com/, Gabor launched issue one and didn't look back. His goal is described clearly as:

"You are busy churning out code or managing the developers. You care about Perl but don't have time to go through tens and hundreds of articles and blog posts every day. You want to keep an eye on the development of Perl without drowning in a sea of blog posts. You need someone to point out the most important news and articles in the Perl World.
Let me be your guide."

"Perl Weekly":http://perlweekly.com/ reached its 22nd issue on 26th December (it is released without fail every Monday no matter what other commitments Gabor has) and will enter 2012 with an issue on the 2nd January. If you want to follow events in the Perl world and do not have time to sift through the wealth of different sources you should subscribe to Perl Weekly (while also keeping the occasional eye on the "Perl Foundation Homepage":http://www.perlfoundation.org and "blog":http://news.perlfoundation.org/ [shameless plug]) and "Like/follow their Facebook page":https://www.facebook.com/PerlWeekly?sk=wall.

"Perl Weekly":http://perlweekly.com/ has over 2,200 subscribers but we know there are many more people out there who can and should subscribe and benefit from Gabor's hard work, you needn't be an advocate of Perl, just interested in how the community and language is developing and evolving.

"Gabor Szabo":http://szabgab.com/about.html has been active in the Perlverse for many years, he is a "professional Perl Trainer":http://szabgab.com/training.html who has recently started a cost-effective series of "online Perl training courses":http://www.udemy.com/beginner-perl-maven/?affcode=E0QfcFhUT3oIUQ== under the "Perl Maven brand":http://szabgab.com/beginner-perl-maven.html. "The first in this series":http://szabgab.com/training.html is aimed at people new to Perl and will efficiently introduce you to programming concepts and best practices in Perl.

Gabor is a keen developer as well and is the founder of "Padre (the Perl IDE)":http://padre.perlide.org/, he is also the maintainer of the "CPAN forum":http://cpanforum.com/ and has a number of "modules on CPAN":http://search.cpan.org/~szabgab/. Gabor was awarded the prestigious "'White Camel' in 2008":http://whitecamel.org/ for his contributions to the Perl Community, but isn't the type of person who allows praise to let him rest on his laurels.

Gabor is an organiser for the "Israel Perl Workshop in 2012":http://act.perl.org.il/ilpw2012/ (which he had a principal position in resurrecting after a short hiatus) and a regular speaker at many Perl events.
